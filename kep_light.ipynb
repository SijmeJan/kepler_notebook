    "Kepler observations are divided into quarters. In order to search for planets around other stars, the Kepler space telescope performed near-continuous monitoring of a single field of view, from an Earth-trailing orbit. However, this posed a challenge. If the space telescope is trailing Earth and maintaining steady pointing, its solar panels would slowly receive less and less sunlight. In order to make sure the solar panels remained oriented towards the Sun, Kepler performed quarterly rolls, one every 93 days. After each roll, Kepler retained its fine-pointing at the same field of view. Because the camera rotated by 90 degrees, all of the target stars fell on different parts of the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. This had an effect on the amount of flux recorded for the same star, because different CCD pixels have different sensitivities. Therefore, a different quarter may give a different brightness for the same star!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, each quarter of data looks strikingly different, with global patterns repeating every four quarters as Kepler has made a full rotation. The change in flux within each quarter is in part driven by changes in the telescope focus, which are caused by changes in the temperature of Kepler’s components as the spacecraft orbits the Sun. The changes are also caused by an effect called differential velocity aberration (DVA), which causes stars to drift over the course of a quarter, depending on their distance from the center of Kepler’s field of view.\n",

You can think of this as doing a [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) and look for the period where there is the highest power. In cases where the signal is very far from sinusoidal, other algorithms perform better than the Fourier transform. Here, we use a special algorithm for transits, called the [Box Least Squares](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/timeseries/bls.html) periodogram. Its output is very similar to a Fourier transform: power as a function of period (or frequency). \n",
